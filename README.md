# nginx-proxy-acme-docker-compose
## A simplified deployment of https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy and https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion

- Clone this project into your desired directory for running the docker-compose.
- Edit docker-compose.yml the final networks section, changing `my-nginx-proxy` to the desired name of your external facing network (existing or not)
- If you need to create that external network, use `docker network create my-nginx-proxy` (or whatever name you chose and used in `docker-compose.yml`.

You can adjust the `uploadsize.conf` file in `conf.d` to any desired size. 

`conf.d\realip.conf` helps downstream apps recognize that the private IP of the proxy is NOT the real IP of the incoming requests. Some Apache based apps need some additional help with this.

After starting up the proxy, a `default.conf` will be created in `conf.d`. Do not edit this file, it is managed by the container. It is exposed here to help you debug any application you are setting up, as you can see the rules created for nginx and adjust accordingly in the application.

Directories named `acme.sh`, `vhost.d`, `certs` and `html` will be created. Refer to the `nginx` and `acme-companion` docs (links to the repos at the top of the README.md) for further information.
